# Big Picture View.
* __$42 trillion__ ocean of the U.S. stock market.

* __As of Dec. 31__, heavily shorted stocks like AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc.,BlackBerry Ltd.,iRobot Corp., and others lately favored by the flash mob made up only 0.13% of the S&P 500 and only 4% to 5% of leading indexes of small stocks

* __By Jan. 27__, the most-shorted stocks still accounted for only 0.17% of the S&P 500. They did roughly double to 8.6% of the S&P 600 Small-Cap index,which includes GameStop and several other flash-mob favorites, and 11% of the Russell Microcap index. But investors who are well diversified aren’t likely to feel a major impact.

* __Volatility for the S&P 500 index__ so far in 2021 is up a bit but still ranks almost exactly in the middle of its levels recorded since 1928, according to Distillate Capital Partners LLC., a Chicago-based investment firm

* __Volatility of even the S&P 600 index__ of small stocks, which includes GameStop and several other flash-mob favorites, has fluctuated about one-third less sharply in 2021 than its long-run average.

* Taken together, these indicators suggest the flash mobs haven’t had significant effects outside the two- or three-dozen stocks they love to trade the most.
* But it’s simplistic to think of this trading movement as a frontal assault on Wall Street’s elite
* “The desire to get rich without labor has prevailed among men at all ages,” wrote the journalist and economist Horace White in 1909, “and will doubtless continue as long as human nature remains unchanged.”

* This movement is the culmination of nearly five decades of the democratization of markets investors should regard it as the latest phase in a long evolution—and unlikely to disrupt markets overall.
