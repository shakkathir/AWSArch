* Alternatively, when using ALBs, the underlying IP addresses of the compute nodes
    supporting the ALB are subject to change, for example, in response to scaling events.
    *Because an ALB is not supported by a static compute node, or static group of compute
    nodes, it does not support direct integration with Elastic IP addresses. Static IP
    addresses can still be provided to consumers of ALB-based applications via AWS
    Global Accelerator, a service that provides fixed entry points to your application*

* The volume should be configured with 1-TB as gp2 volumes provide *3 IOPS per GB, 3000 IOPS / TB* which will allow the full 3,000 IOPS to be achieved.  
* This HDD volume type supports a maximum of 500 IOPS per volume.  

>[aws link](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-volume-types.html)Between a minimum of 100 IOPS (at 33.33 GiB and below) and a maximum of 16,000 IOPS (at 5,334 GiB and above), baseline performance scales linearly at 3 IOPS per GiB of volume size. AWS designs gp2 volumes to deliver their provisioned performance 99% of the time. A gp2 volume can range in size from 1 GiB to 16 TiB.  
* EFS will be much more expensive than using a gp2 volume

> How does BlockPublicAcls and IgnorePublicAcls work differently?

*For example, AWS S3 api has a call such as* [*put-object*](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/s3api/put-object.html) *have option* `*--acl*`*. With this you can not only upload object, but also make it publicly available.*

When `Block Public Access` is off, call

```
aws s3api put-object --bucket some-bucket --acl public-read --key test.file

```

successes, and `test.file` will be not only uploaded, but also publicly available.

Now, if you enable:

*   `BlockPublicAcls`: the above **API will fail**. Any API which allows `*--acl public-read*`will be rejected. So `test.file` won't be uploaded.
*   `IgnorePublicAcls`: **API call succeeds**. The file is uploaded, but option `*--acl public-read*`is **ignored** and the file is private.
