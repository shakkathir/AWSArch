     > We had our own in place before control tower came out. So far it's been worth sticking with terraform and our customizations, 
     > particularly around SSO their way and our way. We look at it every so often, but we'd wind up using terraform to customize 
     > the accounts rather than cloudformation and we'd still have custom scripts to run to configure things so we haven't switched over.

     > Landing zone, service catalog, cdk, lots of things that tie to cloudformation that we've continued to avoid.
