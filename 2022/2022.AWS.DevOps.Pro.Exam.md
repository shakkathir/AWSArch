QUESTION 14 OF 20

*14. QUESTION

To increase security, a company plans to use AWS Systems Manager Session Manager to managed Amazon EC2 instances rather than SSH. The connectivity to Session Manager should also use a private network connection.*

Which configuration actions should be taken to implement this? (Select TWO.)

  - Attach an Elastic IP to a NAT gateway in a public subnet and specify a route to the NAT gateway in the private subnet route tables.
- Create a VPC endpoint for Systems Manager in the Region where the instances are running.
- Attach an IAM instance profile to the EC2 instances that provides the necessary permissions for Systems Manager.
- Establish private Session Manager connectivity using the instance IDs of EC2 instances.
- Allow inbound access to TCP port 22 in all associated EC2 security groups from the VPC CIDR range.
